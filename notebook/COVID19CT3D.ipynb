This model will classify whether the volumetric medical image from a 3D CT scan of the thorax is infected by COVID-19 or not. The model's output is a single-valued tensor that represents the probability of being infected by COVID-19. This tutorial is based on https://github.com/hasibzunair/3D-image-classification-tutorial."
